## Quotes
>"I'm with mammoth, i don't do that." - Manny

## Why this line thrills me
this line is incredibly powerful becuase it encapsulates manny;s reluctance and eventual growth throughout the movie. 
Manny's declaration is a humorous yet piognant assertion of his personality, challenging the expectation placed on him by others himself.
